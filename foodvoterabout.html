            <p>Thank you for visiting the Food Voter web application! This was a fun project to put together
                to help people with deciding on where to eat. So how did this all start? Well a quick backstory
                for you! For my job, I had to go out to our main offices in Kansas. The dreaded question was 
                always asked at the same time of day of where everybody wanted to go to eat when it was time 
                for a lunch break. The question was always asked on Microsoft Teams and my chat would blow up
                while I was on the phone working with a customer. I thoughtt that there had to be a better way 
                to figure out where everybody wanted to go out to eat because my Teams chat blowing up every 2 minutes
                was way to distracting. So I got to work on creating this web application to help people decide on where
                they would like to go out to eat.
