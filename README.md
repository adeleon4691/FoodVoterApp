# FoodVoterApp
Food Voter App was designed to help groups of people decide on the type of food that they should eat for events. 
This idea started out when I was out of town on a business trip and I quickly got tired of my Microsoft Teams chat blowing up with 
questions about where to eat. 
Food Voter is meant to help save time and stress when trying to decide where to eat for meals.
It's simple. Login or sign up, set up a voting poll, invite your friends, vote, and then get your results.
